<!--
  Entry HTML file for the React application.
  
  This is the single HTML page that serves as the container for the React app:
  - Contains the root <div id="root"> where React will mount
  - Includes the script tag that loads the compiled JavaScript bundle
  - Can include meta tags, title, favicon links, etc.
  - Vite injects the bundled JavaScript automatically during development/build
